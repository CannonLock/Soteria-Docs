#Overview

A Soteria project is a repository that is created through Soteria, distributed by Harbor and managed by Comanage.



## Permissions

Each project in Soteria is provided with a [Comanage](https://incommon.org/software/comanage/) 
group to organize user permissions.

Affiliates are auto assigned Developer level permissions to their temporary project.

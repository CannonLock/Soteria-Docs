# Welcome to Soteria's Documentation

If you know what Soteria is about and are eager to begin you can [get started](get-started.md).

## About

Soteria is a [Container Registry]() for open science dedicated to advance three areas:

- __Discoverability__:
    - Make images easy-to-cite and generate reasonable metadata 
      (such as funding agencies and grant #s) for creation of DOIs and archival.
      
- __Visibility__:
    - Communicate the contents of the container easily? This includes
      advertising the software discovered, such as the system RPMs and known vulnerabilities
      
- __Traceability__:
    - For security response, track what containers are used at which NSF resources.
    
## Availability

Soteria will be available to any US-based researcher and their collaborators.
